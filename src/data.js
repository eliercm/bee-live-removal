    question: "Why is it important to remove bees alive?",
    answer:
      "The use of pesticides has greatly reduced the population of bees. Bees are beneficial for our planet " +
      "because they contribute to pollination. Today there are 100 species of crops that provide 90% of the " +
      "food throughout the world, 70 of them are pollinated by bees. If the bees become extinct, our food chain " +
      "would practically collapse, we would lose more than 2000 species of edible plants. We offer the removal and " +
      "relocation, we do not eliminate the colony with poisons, but instead, we remove the colony and relocate them " +
      "to a place where they can survive and thrive. We remove either a simple swarm that has just arrived or if it is " + 
      "an established colony that has existed for years. Our most ecological approach is not only to save the bees but " +
      "also to help save our planet. We use the correct methods during the process of removing bees alive. Only those swarms " +
      "that are Africanized and are a danger due to their aggressiveness will be eliminated."
